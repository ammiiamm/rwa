# Original Keras implementation
https://gist.github.com/shamatar/55b804cf62b8ee0fa23efdb3ea5a4701  
(This repo's implemetation is almost same as the above gist script.  
I fixed the code to support `return_sequence` parameter for visualizing hidden states.)

# Note
Current implementation is heavily under development.  
Any code has not been systemically tested.  
Envitonment arguments are hard-coded.

# Usage
## settings
Please fix the `save_root_dir` variable and `if __name__ == '__main__'` section in scripts before execution!

## commands
```bash
python training.py  # train RWA (or LSTM. See and fix `__main__` section to switch the model)
python plotting.py  # plot internal states of RWA. (Before execution, check your trained model filename and fix the variables in this file!)
```
